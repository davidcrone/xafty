# xafty

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

xafty makes it easy to build a scalable and collaborative data network. This is achieved by organizing the code as 
a Directed Acyclic Tree (DAG) instead of running it top-to-bottom via a script. The main goal is to build a data pipeline that 
is easy extendable, easy improvable, and still easy to use.

## Installation

``` r
 pak::pkg_install("davidcrone/xafty")
```
