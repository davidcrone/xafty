Title: Build a Scalable Data Pipeline
Version: 0.2.0
Author: person(given = "David", family = "Crone", email = "davidjvcrone@gmail.com")
Maintainer: David Crone <davidjvcrone@gmail.com>
Description: xafty lets you build data pipelines as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), 
  turning each step into a reusable node in a knowledge network. 
  This makes pipelines more scalable, easier to collaborate on, 
  and less complex over time through layered abstraction.
