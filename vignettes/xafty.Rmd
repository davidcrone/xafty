The goal of xafty is to build R-based pipelines that are reusable, scalable, and easy to collaborate on. To achieve this end, xafty represents your pipeline as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each step becomes a node in a network. 

This changes how you work with pipelines in one significant way: instead of executing steps in a predetermined sequence, xafty dynamically constructs the pipeline at run time based on the data you request.

This article gives you an intro to building network-pipelines. If you’ve already put together pipelines in R using base R or dplyr, you’ve got everything you need to start building them with xafty.

# Setup

```{r setup}
library(xafty)
```

To create a network object, we call `xafty::init_network()`.

``` {r}
network <- init_network("intro_network")
```
Each network object must have at least one project in order to start building the network pipeline. 

A project can be added as follows:

``` {r}
network$add_project("mtcars")
```
Projects are multi-purpose structures which are used to hold and organize your nodes, as well as encapsulate logic and settings how nodes should be treated within their respective projects.

This is all the setup we need to start building our network. From here, the process is just like creating any other pipeline: we need data and the transformation steps that operate on it.

# Building a Network Pipeline

Let’s add the mtcars dataset to our network. 

To do that, we write a function that returns the data.frame:

``` {r}
get_mtcars <- function() {
  data("mtcars", envir = environment())
  mtcars
}

head(get_mtcars())

```

To start building a network pipeline, we register the function into the `mtcars` project:

``` {r}
network$mtcars$link(get_mtcars())
```

Since the function `get_mtcars` has no dependencies, it is automatically set as the root node of the project. **Note:** currently, xafty expects a project to have only one or no root node.

We can inspect the project by printing it to the console and query the network for our desired variables:

``` {r}
# Inspecting the network
network

# Querying a project by its name, will return all variables from that project
mtcars <- query("mtcars") |> nascent(network)

# Querying variables will only return the declared variables
data <- query(mtcars = c("carb", "gear")) |> nascent(network)

# Querying can also be done via unquoted symbols
data <- query(carb, gear) |> nascent(network)

head(data)

```
## Adding a Node

To let our network grow, we simply query the data we need from the network, write a step as a function that transforms the data, and register the function again into the network:

``` {r}

# 1. Check what variables you have available in the project
network$mtcars

# 2. retrieve data from the network
data <- query(mtcars = c("hp", "wt")) |> nascent(network)

# 3. write the transformation step
add_power_to_weight <- function(data) {
  data$power_to_weight <- data$hp / data$wt
  data
}

# 4. register the step back into the network
network$mtcars$link(add_power_to_weight(data = query(mtcars = c("hp", "wt"))))

```

When registering a transformation step in the network, we do not pass data directly to the function. Instead, we declare the required inputs using `xafty::query`. Internally, this query is resolved by `xafty::nascent()` to obtain the actual data and evaluate the function's return value, so the network can determine which variables it contributes.

To avoid recalculating the entire data pipeline, you can register the function by explicitly stating which variables it adds to the network using the parameter `vars`:

``` {r}
network$mtcars$link(fun = add_power_to_weight(data = query(mtcars = c("hp", "wt"))), 
                   vars = "power_to_weight", update = TRUE)
# Note: Setting update = TRUE prevents the network from asking
# whether an already registered function should be updated.
network$mtcars
```

Each transformation step (e.g. the function `add_power_to_weight`) in a xafty network is written as a **"pass-through"** function. Such a function must satisfy the following requirements:

- It must refer to variables by name, as column positions cannot be guaranteed. (If your function depends on a specific data structure rather than just variable names, you should use `objects` instead.)
- It must leave the input `data.frame` unchanged and return the entire `data.frame` with the added transformation (as embodied by `dplyr::mutate`).

These are necessary conditions that make network pipelines possible and connect to a larger vision: 

In a network pipeline, each node represents a self-contained transformation that encapsulates knowledge about how to derive specific outputs from given inputs. Rather than being a temporary, task-specific function, a node defines a reusable mapping between data states, forming a building block in the network’s directed acyclic graph. As new patterns in the data emerge and domain knowledge continues to grow, nodes will be refined and updated. I envision network pipelines as a continuously evolving data structures that captures and preserves all the domain knowledge a data analyst can express in code.

## Adding a Join

To join two data sources, we first need to create a second project with another root node:

``` {r}
network$add_project("engine")

get_engine_details <- function() {
  engine <- data.frame(
    type = as.factor(c("Straight", "V-Shape")),
    vs = c(1, 0)
  )
  engine
}

network$engine$link(get_engine_details())

network
```

The join is then added to the network as another transformation step. We tell the network that we wish to register a join by passing two separate query-calls to the function:

``` {r}
join_engine_details <- function(mtcars, engine) {
  joined <- merge(mtcars, engine, by = "vs", all.x = TRUE, sort = FALSE)
  joined
}

network$mtcars$link(join_engine_details(mtcars = query(mtcars = "vs"),
                                        engine = query(engine = "vs")), direction = "one")

network$mtcars
```

By default, we create a one-directional join (a left join) from project engine to mtcars using the link function in the mtcars project. If we want to establish a bi-directional join (for example, an inner join), we must set the direction parameter of the link function to "both".

To declare that a function depends on a join, register it using a single `xafty::query()` call that includes at least two different projects with root nodes:

``` {r}
add_combined_label <- function(data) {
  data$combined_label <- paste(
     data$type, 
     ifelse(data$am == 0, "Auto", "Manual"),
      sep = "_"
  )
  data
}

network$mtcars$link(add_combined_label(data = query(mtcars = "am", engine = "type")))

```
## Grouped Operations

In many workflows, we temporarily group data so that downstream transformations can operate with group-level context. In a typical dplyr pipeline, this is as simple as calling group_by(), performing the transformation, and then calling ungroup().

In a xafty network pipeline, however, grouping must be attached as contexts to a project. Because nodes are independent and assembled dynamically, grouping cannot be embedded inline within each function. Instead, xafty lets you define grouped execution contexts at the project level using **entry** and **exit** hooks.

A project can automatically group data when a node is entered and ungroup it when the node finishes, allowing transformation functions to assume grouped input without containing grouping logic themselves.

We start by defining three pass-through functions:

``` {r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

group_by_gear <- function(data) {
  group_by(data, gear)
}

ungroup_data <- function(data) {
  ungroup(data)
}

add_mean_hp_per_gear <- function(data) {
  mutate(data, mean_hp_per_gear = mean(hp))
}

```

Next, we create a new context that we will attach to the variable:
``` {r}
network$mtcars$add_context("per_gear", 
                           on_entry = group_by_gear(data = query(mtcars = "gear")), 
                           on_exit = ungroup_data(data = "{.data}"))
```

Using the on_entry and on_exit hooks, we specify when the functions should run.

Setting the parameter to `{.data}`, will pass the entire data.frame to the parameter. Currently, this works only with entry and exit nodes. 

Now, we register the node and attach the context `per_gear` to it so it inherits the grouping behavior when they run.

``` {r}
network$mtcars$link(add_mean_hp_per_gear(data = query(mtcars = "hp")), attach_context = "per_gear")

data <- query(mtcars = c("gear", "mean_hp_per_gear")) |> 
  nascent(network)

head(data)
```

## Filtering

xafty handles filters through the `xafty::where` function:

``` {r}
data <- query(mtcars = "mean_hp_per_gear", engine = "type") |> 
  xafty::where(type == "Straight") |> 
  nascent(network)

head(data)
```

Currently, the filter is applied at the end of the execution and is not pushed back.

## Developer Toolings

As your network grows, it becomes increasingly important to understand how xafty assembles and executes your pipeline. Since nodes are combined dynamically based on the variables you request, xafty provides tools to inspect the resulting execution plan before running it.

The function `build_dag()` constructs the directed acyclic graph for a given query and returns a list-object that describes the full pipeline:

``` {r}
  dag <- query(mtcars = c("gear", "mean_hp_per_gear"), engine = "type") |> 
          build_dag(network)
```

For example, the element `dag$execution_order` shows the exact order of the assembled pipeline.

``` {r}
  dag$execution_order
```

xafty also supports a digestible way how contents of a network are printed. Simply pass your network object to the console to use this feature:

``` {r}
  network$mtcars
```

# States

States provide a mechanism for parameterizing network execution at query time. They allow you to expose configurable values, such as styling options, thresholds, or model parameters, without hard-coding them into transformation functions or objects.

States are defined on the network using `add_state()` and may optionally specify a default value (If no default value is set, the network will use `NULL` as a default):

``` {r}
network$add_state("date_state", default = Sys.Date())
```

Once defined, a state can be referenced inside a function by using its name wrapped in curly braces:

``` {r}

add_date <- function(data, date = NULL) {
  data$date <- date
  data
}

network$mtcars$link(add_date(data = query(mtcars = "am"), 
                             date = "{date_state}"))

```

To assign a concrete value to a state for a specific execution, use `xafty::with_state()` when constructing the query:

``` {r}

data <- query(am, mean_hp_per_gear, date) |> 
  with_state(date_state = "2026-02-02") |> 
  nascent(network)
head(data, n = 3)

```

States turn an otherwise rigid network into a flexible execution framework. They enable the same network structure to produce different outputs without modification, providing a high-level and controlled way to adapt results to a specific use case.

## Defining a Join Path

xafty constructs join paths using a greedy best-first-search algorithm. This approach works well as long as the join relationships in the network are unambiguous. As a network grows and additional projects and joins are added, however, the automatically selected join path may no longer match the intended data flow.

To explicitly control how joins are resolved, you can attach a predefined join path to a query using `xafty::add_join_path()`:

``` {r}

data <- query(mtcars = "power_to_weight", engine = "type") |> 
  add_join_path(path = c("mtcars", "engine")) |> 
  nascent(network)

head(data, n = 3)

```

More formally, multiple join paths can be defined for a single query:

``` {r}

qry <- query(projectA = "col1", projectB = "col2", projectC = "col3")
query_join <- add_join_path(qry, join1 = c("projectA", "projectB"), 
                            join2 = c("projectA", "projectC"))
```

This configuration results in two joins being applied: `projectA` is joined with `projectB`, and `projectA` is joined with `projectC`. Explicit join paths provide a reliable way to control join behavior in complex networks and help prevent unintended join resolutions as the network evolves.

# Wrap-Up

This article introduced the core ideas behind xafty and showed how data pipelines can be modeled as explicit, inspectable networks of transformations. By separating data dependencies, execution logic, and query intent, xafty makes pipelines easier to extend, reason about, and reuse as they grow.

xafty is still in its experimental form, and feedback from you use is essential. If you have ideas, questions, or suggestions, or if you are experimenting with xafty in your own projects, [I would love to hear from you](mailto:davidjvcrone@gmail.com). Your input will help shape the next steps of the framework.
